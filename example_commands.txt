# To build the docker with latest packages we instaled using the pip package
docker compose up -d --build

# To activate the environment 
source aws_realtime_spark/bin/activate

#To run the spark streaming socked in the spark master we will go in to shell

docker exec -it spark-master /bin/bash
list the jobs - ls (with in the jobs folder)
we will run using python - python3 jobs/streaming-socket.py

we will get below statement after execution of previous code 

Server listening for incoming connections on the host: 127.0.0.1 and port: 9999

Now we can submit the job from the spark-worker

docker exec -it spark-worker spark-submit \  <------------------- This is not working
--master spark://172.22.0.2:7077 \
--packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.0 \
jobs/spark-streaming.py

docker exec -it spark-master spark-submit \ < <------------------- This is working ( Also change host as 127.0.0.1 in both programs)
--master spark://172.18.0.2:7077 \
--packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.0 \ 
jobs/spark-streaming.py

One roll surprised us by having sweet mustard sauce on it, which did NOT taste very good....\nOn the bright side, once we actually got our orders in they didn't take all that long to make them.",
